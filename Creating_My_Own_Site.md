# Blog Post #1: Creating My Own Site

This isn't going to be a highly technical post. It's just my experiences and thoughts on building your own website.

## Starting Out
Thoughtout the past year, I've noticed most job applications ask for your own website. I didn't really think much of it, but then I started to think about the different ways you could have your "own" blog or personal website. There's sort of a spectrum of options. On one end, you have websites like Medium that just require you to sign up for an account and all you have to bring are the posts. And on the other end, you have running all of you own hardware out of your home and managing the machine yourself. I decided on somewhere in the middle by using AWS services and a domain registar and it's nameservers. For the website itself, I settled on a small back end, wholly unnecessary but I just wanted to get more familiar with Go, and a React frontend. I'm also using Tailwind for the styling.

## Decisions, decisions
My choice of tech stack ultimately came down to a combination of their popularity, my interest in them, and whether or not I have used them before. I chose React because I have never really used React before and I wanted to see how much different from Angular it could be. I decided to add in Tailwind mostly to avoid having to work with Bootstrap and building everything from the ground up with CSS. The website is simply a splash page with links to blog posts. The backend is a bit more interesting and came about because I wanted to do something with Go. Instead of just writing my posts directly in the React files I wanted a more general form of them. I decided I would write the posts in markdown directly to a Github repository and have it dynamically update on my website. I figured I could just create some sort of batch job on the EC2 to periodically pull from the repository and copy the contents into a folder that I would serve with Go. That's how I actually learned that Unix has a system level CRON job executor. All you have to do is ```crontab -e``` and add a CRON expression and a shell script and the operating system will take care of the rest. Go actually has standard library support for simple file servers, however I wanted the ability to have REST endpoints so I ended up using Gin.

## The importance of building things
I do think reading and educating yourself on different topics and technologies is extremely valuable. But a really important aspect of software engineering is just working on and building things. It's amazing the amount of information you're able to remember. It also helps me build a better mental model of systems and how they work. It really is something that you just slowly build on little by little, so it's important to reflect on where you were and where you are now just to see the progress you've made.
