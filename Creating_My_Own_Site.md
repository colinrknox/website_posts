# Blog Post #1: Creating My Own Site

This isn't going to be a highly technical post. It's just my experiences and thoughts on building your own website.

## Starting Out
Thoughtout the past year, I've noticed almost every single job application asks for your own website. I didn't really think much of it, but then I started to think about the different ways you could have your "own" blog or personal website. There's sort of a spectrum of options. On one end, you have websites like Medium that just require you to sign up and all you have to bring are the posts. And on the other end, you have running all of you own hardware out of your home and managing the machine yourself. I decided on somewhere in the middle by using AWS services and a domain registar. For the website itself, I settled on a small back end, wholly unnecessary but I just wanted to get more familiar with Go, and a React frontend. I'll probably introduce Tailwind at some point as well.

## Decisions, decisions
My choice of tech stack ultimately came down to a combination of their popularity, my interest in them, and whether or not I have used them before. I decided I would make this website using React since I have never really used React before. These technologies are obviously overkill for what is essentially just plain text content, but I still would like to learn them and you have to start somewhere. I decided I wanted the ability to write posts in markdown directly to a Github repository and have it dynamically update on my website. This seemed like a great use case for a Go backend with an EC2 instance.

## The importance of building things
I do think reading and educating yourself on different topics and technologies is extremely valuable. But a really important aspect of software engineering is just working on and building things. It's amazing the amount of information you're able to remember. It also helps me build a better mental model of systems and how they work. It really is something that you just slowly build on little by little, so it's important to reflect on where you were and where you are now just to see the progress you've made.
